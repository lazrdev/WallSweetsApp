WallSweets
*based on Frames*
======
Explore a wide variety of hand-made wallpapers in a range of styles

WallSweets delivers a constantly expanding library of wallpapers, for free and ad-free!

App is based on Frames, an open source wallpaper dashboard (https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/Frames), and it is designed to deliver a fun experience and a breathtaking UI, with a lot of rounded corners and Material You theming (Android 12 and up).

Wallpapers are grouped into collections so that you can find your style of wallpapers faster.

App features a color palette extractor in the 'Info' tab of every wallpaper.

Wallpaper updates don't have a schedule, they are released as they are made.

WallSweets does not allow commercial use of any wallpaper that is present in the application. If found any such unfair happening, strict actions will be taken against them.
